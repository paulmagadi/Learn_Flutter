# Basic Flutter Program


**Steps To Create Flutter Project**

Let’s create a flutter project called first_app. Follow the below steps to create a flutter project.

1. Open command prompt/terminal.
2. Type flutter create first_app and press enter.
3. Type cd first_app and press enter.
4. Type code . to open project with visual studio code.

*Example 1: Hello World Program*

This is a simple Flutter application that displays Hello World on screen. First, open the main.dart file from the lib folder and replace the code with the below code.

```
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(
    MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: const Text('My First App'),
        ),
        body: const Center(
          child: Text('Hello World!'),
        ),
      ),
    ),
  );
}
```

**Basic Flutter Program Explained**

- The import ‘package:flutter/material.dart’; means we’re using the Material design package from Flutter.
- The void main() {…} function is where every Flutter application starts.
- The runApp(…); function is how we initialize and launch the app’s UI.
- The MaterialApp widget is our foundation for creating Material Design apps in Flutter.
- The Scaffold widget provides a basic visual structure, like a canvas, to design our app upon.
- The AppBar widget is like the top bar of an app, where we can place a title or action buttons.
- The Text widget is simply for displaying text on the screen.
- The Center widget centers the child widget.

5. Run Flutter Project

To run flutter project, go to run menu and click on Start Debugging or Run Without Debugging. You can also run the project with this command.

`flutter run`

**Challenge**

- Create a flutter project called second_app. Display your name on screen.


WIDGETS IN FLUTTER
What is Flutter Widgets?
In Flutter, everything on the screen is a widget. Flutter widgets are the UI elements that you see on the screen e.g. button, text, image, list, etc. Widgets can be either stateful or stateless.

Types of Widgets in Flutter
Flutter widgets are broadly categorized into:

Stateless Widget
Stateful Widget
Stateless Widget
Stateless widgets are immutable. Once you define their properties, they remain constant and don’t change. They are the go-to choice for displaying static content like text, images, or icons.

 Info
Note: You can use stl shortcut to create a stateless widget in VS Code.

Example of a Stateless Widget:

class MyStatelessWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  final String text;

  MyStatelessWidget({required this.text});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Text(text);
  }
}
Stateful Widget
Stateful widgets are dynamic and can change during their lifecycle, usually in response to user interactions or real-time data updates. They are essential for content that evolves over time, such as a shopping cart’s contents.

 Info
Note: You can use stf shortcut to create a stateful widget in VS Code.

Example of a Stateful Widget:

class MyStatefulWidget extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MyStatefulWidgetState createState() => _MyStatefulWidgetState();
}

class _MyStatefulWidgetState extends State<MyStatefulWidget> {
  int counter = 0;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return ElevatedButton(
      onPressed: () {
        setState(() {
          counter++;
        });
      },
      child: Text('You have pressed the button $counter times.'),
    );
  }
}
Stateless Vs Stateful Widgets
Stateless Widgets	Stateful Widgets
Properties	Stateless widgets remain constant and don’t change	Stateful widgets can change their appearance based on events or data.
Use Case	For static content (e.g., buttons, icons)	For dynamic content (e.g., user interactions)
State	No internal state	Maintains internal state that can be updated
Rebuild	Entire widget tree rebuilt on state changes	Rebuilds only the widget affected by state change
Most Used Flutter Widgets
Text: It is used to display text on the screen.
Container: It is used to display a rectangular box on the screen.
Row: It is used to display widgets in a horizontal manner.
Column: It is used to display widgets in a vertical manner.
Stack: It is used to display widgets on top of each other.
 Info
Note: You can use Container widget to add padding, margin, border, background color, etc. to other widgets.

          ],
        ),
      ),
    ),
  );
}
Row Properties
These are the most common useful properties of the Row widget which helps you control the layout of its children:

Property	Description
mainAxisAlignment	Determines how the children are aligned horizontally.
crossAxisAlignment	Determines how the children are aligned vertically.
children	The widgets that are displayed inside the row.
Main Axis In Row
In Row, main axis determines how the children are aligned horizontally. The mainAxisAlignment property accepts the following values:

MainAxisAlignment Values	Description
MainAxisAlignment.start	Children are aligned at the start of the horizontal axis.
MainAxisAlignment.end	Children are aligned at the end of the horizontal axis.
MainAxisAlignment.center	Children are centered along the horizontal axis.
MainAxisAlignment.spaceBetween	Children have equal spacing between them.
MainAxisAlignment.spaceAround	Children have equal spacing between them, and also the space at the start and the end is divided evenly.
MainAxisAlignment.spaceEvenly	Children have equal spacing before, between, and after them.
Example 3: Main Axis Alignment
In this example, you see 5 stars which are in center horizontally. Run this code online and try changing center to start, end, spaceBetween, spaceAround or spaceEvenly.

import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(
    MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: const Text('Row In Flutter'),
        ),
        body: const Row(
          // Try replacing "center" with "start", "end", "spaceBetween", "spaceAround" or "spaceEvenly"
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            Icon(Icons.star, color: Colors.yellow),
            Icon(Icons.star, color: Colors.yellow),
            Icon(Icons.star, color: Colors.yellow),

          ],
        ),
      ),
    ),
  );
}
 Info
Note: By default mainAxisAlignment value is mainAxisAlignment.start

Cross Axis In Row
In Row, cross axis determines how the children are aligned vertically. The crossAxisAlignment property accepts the following values:

CrossAxisAlignment Values	Description
CrossAxisAlignment.start	Children are aligned at the top of the Row.
CrossAxisAlignment.end	Children are aligned at the bottom of the Row.
CrossAxisAlignment.center	Children are vertically centered in the Row.
CrossAxisAlignment.stretch	Children are forced to fill the available space vertically.
CrossAxisAlignment.baseline	Children are aligned by their baseline (useful for text).
Example 4: Cross Axis Alignment
In this example, you see 5 stars which are in center vertically. Run this code online and try changing center to start, end, stretch, baseline.

import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(
    MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: const Text('Row In Flutter'),
        ),
        body: Container(
          color: Colors.green,
          height: double.infinity,
          child: const Row(
            // Try replacing "center" with "start", "end", "stretch" or "baseline"
            crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.center,
            children: [
              Icon(Icons.star, color: Colors.yellow),

              Icon(Icons.star_border, color: Colors.yellow),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    ),
  );
}
 Info
Note: By default crossAxisAlignment value is crossAxisAlignment.center

Example 5: Using Main Axis & Cross Axis Alignment
In this example, you see 5 stats which are in center horizontally and vertically. Run this code online and try changing its main axis and cross axis alignement.

import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(
    MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: const Text('Row In Flutter'),
        ),
        body: Container(
          color: Colors.green,
          height: double.infinity,
          child: const Row(
            // Try replacing "center" with "start", "end", "spaceAround" or "spaceEvenly"
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            // Try replacing "center" with "start", "end", "stretch" or "baseline"
            crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.center,
            children: [
              Icon(Icons.star, color: Colors.yellow),
              Icon(Icons.star, color: Colors.yellow),
              Icon(Icons.star, color: Colors.yellow),
              Icon(Icons.star, color: Colors.yellow),
              Icon(Icons.star_border, color: Colors.yellow),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    ),
  );
}
Overflow Issue
When you put too many widgets inside a Row and they can’t fit within the screen, you’ll get an overflow error. Here are simple ways to handle this overflow issue in Flutter:

Wrap in SingleChildScrollView widget
Use Expanded or Flexible widget
Example 6: Wrap In SingleChildScrollView
When you have many children widgets, and they can’t all fit on the screen, you might want to scroll to see the ones that are out of view. For more see the example below:

import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(
    MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: const Text('Row In Flutter'),
        ),
        body: Container(
          color: Colors.green,
          height: double.infinity,
          child: SingleChildScrollView(
            scrollDirection: Axis.horizontal,
            child: Row(
              // Try replacing "center" with "start", "end", "spaceAround", "spaceEvenly" or "spaceBetween"
              mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
              // Try replacing "center" with "start", "end", "stretch" or "baseline"
              crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.center,
              children: List.generate(
                  50, (index) => const Icon(Icons.star, color: Colors.yellow)),
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    ),
  );
}
Example 7: Using Expanded
In a Row, use Expanded to make a widget take up all the available remaining space within its parent widget. For more, see the example below:

import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(
    MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: const Text('Row In Flutter'),
        ),
        body: Container(
          color: Colors.green,
          height: double.infinity,
          child: Row(
             // Try replacing "center" with "start", "end", "spaceAround", "spaceEvenly" or "spaceBetween"
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            // Try replacing "center" with "start", "end", "stretch" or "baseline"
            crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.center,
            children: List.generate(
                50,
                (index) =>  const Expanded(
                    child: Icon(Icons.star, color: Colors.yellow))),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    ),
  );
}
Example 8: Using Flexible
Flexible allows a widget within a Row to fit its content but won’t exceed its maximum size, even if there’s extra space available. For more, see the example below:

import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(
    MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: const Text('Row In Flutter'),
        ),
        body: Container(
          color: Colors.green,
          height: double.infinity,
          child: Row(
             // Try replacing "center" with "start", "end", "spaceAround", "spaceEvenly" or "spaceBetween"
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
             // Try replacing "center" with "start", "end", "stretch" or "baseline"
            crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.center,
            children: List.generate(
                50,
                (index) => const Flexible(
                    fit: FlexFit.loose,
                    child: Icon(Icons.star,  color: Colors.yellow))),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    ),
  );
}
 Info
Note: Expanded forces its child to fill available space, while Flexible allows its child to occupy space without necessarily filling it.


COLUMN IN FLUTTER
Column Widget In Flutter
In Flutter, Column widget displays its children vertically. It is very useful when placing UI top to bottom. This is one of the most used widgets in Flutter.

Example 1: Column In Flutter
In this example, the Column contains three children widgets which are Icon, Text, and Icon.

import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(
    MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: const Text('My First App'),
        ),
        body: const Column(
          children: [
            Icon(Icons.star, size: 50),
            Text('I am learning flutter'),
            Icon(Icons.star, size: 50),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    ),
  );
}
Example 2: Create Container Boxes
In this example, you will learn to build 4 different containers inside the Column.

import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(
    MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: const Text('Column In Flutter'),
        ),
        body: Column(
          children: [
            Container(height: 100, width: 100, color: Colors.blue),
            const SizedBox(height: 5),
            Container(height: 100, width: 100, color: Colors.blue),
            const SizedBox(height: 5),
            Container(height: 100, width: 100, color: Colors.blue),
            const SizedBox(height: 5),
            Container(height: 100, width: 100, color: Colors.blue),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    ),
  );
}
Column Properties
These are the most common useful properties of the Column widget which help you control the layout of its children:

Property	Description
mainAxisAlignment	Determines how the children are aligned vertically.
crossAxisAlignment	Determines how the children are aligned horizontally.
children	The widgets that are displayed inside the column.
Main Axis In Column
In Column, the main axis determines how the children are aligned vertically. The mainAxisAlignment property accepts the following values:

MainAxisAlignment Values	Description
MainAxisAlignment.start	Children are aligned at the start of the vertical axis.
MainAxisAlignment.end	Children are aligned at the end of the vertical axis.
MainAxisAlignment.center	Children are centered along the vertical axis.
MainAxisAlignment.spaceBetween	Children have equal spacing between them.
MainAxisAlignment.spaceAround	Children have equal spacing between them, and also the space at the start and the end is divided evenly.
MainAxisAlignment.spaceEvenly	Children have equal spacing before, between, and after them.
Example 3: Main Axis Alignment
In this example, you see 4 containers which are centered vertically. Run this code online and try changing center to start, end, spaceBetween, spaceAround or spaceEvenly.

import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(
    MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: const Text('Column In Flutter'),
        ),
        body: Column(
          // Try replacing "center" with "start", "end", "spaceBetween", "spaceAround" or "spaceEvenly"
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            Container(height: 100, width: 100, color: Colors.blue),
            const SizedBox(height: 5),
            Container(height: 100, width: 100, color: Colors.blue),
            const SizedBox(height: 5),
            Container(height: 100, width: 100, color: Colors.blue),
            const SizedBox(height: 5),
            Container(height: 100, width: 100, color: Colors.blue),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    ),
  );
}
 Info
Note: By default mainAxisAlignment value is mainAxisAlignment.start

Cross Axis In Column
In Column, the cross axis determines how the children are aligned horizontally. The crossAxisAlignment property accepts the following values:

CrossAxisAlignment Values	Description
CrossAxisAlignment.start	Children are aligned at the left of the Column.
CrossAxisAlignment.end	Children are aligned at the right of the Column.
CrossAxisAlignment.center	Children are vertically centered in the Column.
CrossAxisAlignment.stretch	Children are forced to fill the available space horizontally.
CrossAxisAlignment.baseline	Children are aligned by their baseline (useful for text).
Example 4: Cross Axis Alignment
In this example, you see 4 boxes which are centered horizontally. Run this code online and try changing center to start, end, stretch, or baseline.

import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(
    MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: const Text('Column In Flutter'),
        ),
        body: Container(
          color: Colors.green,
          width: double.infinity,
          child: Column(
            // Try replacing "center" with "start", "end", "stretch", or "baseline"
            crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.center,
            children: [
            Container(height: 100, width: 100, color: Colors.blue),
            const SizedBox(height: 5),
            Container(height: 100, width: 100, color: Colors.blue),
            const SizedBox(height: 5),
            Container(height: 100, width: 100, color: Colors.blue),
            const SizedBox(height: 5),
            Container(height: 100, width: 100, color: Colors.blue),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    ),
  );
}
 Info
Note: By default crossAxisAlignment value is crossAxisAlignment.center

Example 5: Using Main Axis & Cross Axis Alignment
In this example, you see 4 containers which are aligned vertically in the center. Run this code online and try changing its main axis and cross axis alignment.

import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(
    MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: const Text('Column In Flutter'),
        ),
        body: Container(
          color: Colors.green,
          width: double.infinity,
          child: SingleChildScrollView(
            scrollDirection: Axis.vertical,
            child: Column(
              // Try replacing "center" with "start", "end", "spaceAround", "spaceEvenly" or "spaceBetween"
              mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
              // Try replacing "center" with "start", "end", "stretch" or "baseline"
              crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.center,
              children: List.generate(
                  50, (index) => Padding(
                    padding: const EdgeInsets.all(8.0),
                    child: Container(height: 100, width: 100, color: Colors.white),
                  )),
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    ),
  );
}
Overflow Issue
When you put too many widgets inside a Column and they can’t fit within the screen, you’ll get an overflow error. Here are simple ways to handle this overflow issue in Flutter:

Wrap in SingleChildScrollView widget
Use Expanded or Flexible widget
Example 6: Wrap In SingleChildScrollView
When you have many children widgets, and they can’t all fit on the screen, you might want to scroll to see the ones that are out of view. For more see the example below:

import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(
    MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: const Text('Column In Flutter'),
        ),
        body: Container(
          color: Colors.green,
          width: double.infinity,
          child: SingleChildScrollView(
            scrollDirection: Axis.vertical,
            child: Column(
              // Try replacing "center" with "start", "end", "spaceAround", "spaceEvenly" or "spaceBetween"
              mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
              // Try replacing "center" with "start", "end", "stretch" or "baseline"
              crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.center,
              children: List.generate(
                  50, (index) => Padding(
                    padding: const EdgeInsets.all(8.0),
                    child: Container(height: 100, width: 100, color: Colors.white),
                  )),
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    ),
  );
}
Example 7: Using Expanded
In a Column, use Expanded to make a widget take up all the available remaining space within its parent widget. For more, see the example below:

import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(
    MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: const Text('Column In Flutter'),
        ),
        body: Container(
          color: Colors.green,
          width: double.infinity,
          child: Column(
             // Try replacing "center" with "start", "end", "spaceAround", "spaceEvenly" or "spaceBetween"
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            // Try replacing "center" with "start", "end", "stretch" or "baseline"
            crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.center,
            children: List.generate(
                50,
                (index) => Expanded(
                    child: Padding(
                    padding: const EdgeInsets.all(8.0),
                    child: Container(height: 100, width: 100, color: Colors.white),
                  ))),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    ),
  );
}
Example 8: Using Flexible
Flexible allows a widget within a Column to fit its content but won’t exceed its maximum size, even if there’s extra space available. For more, see the example below:

import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(
    MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: const Text('Column In Flutter'),
        ),
        body: Container(
          color: Colors.green,
          width: double.infinity,
          child: Column(
             // Try replacing "center" with "start", "end", "spaceAround", "spaceEvenly" or "spaceBetween"
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
             // Try replacing "center" with "start", "end", "stretch" or "baseline"
            crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.center,
            children: List.generate(
                50,
                (index) => Flexible(
                    fit: FlexFit.loose,
                    child: Padding(
                    padding: const EdgeInsets.all(8.0),
                    child: Container(height: 100, width: 100, color: Colors.white),
                  ))),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    ),
  );
}
 Info
Note: Expanded forces its child to fill available space, while Flexible allows its child to occupy space without necessarily filling it.



Row and Column Flutter
Row and Column helps you to align its children horizontally and vertically. These widgets are important when designing the user interface for an application.

Row	Column
Arranges children horizontally.	Arranges children vertically.
Example 1: Row & Column
In this example, you will learn to use Row and Column widgets together with a CircleAvatar to create a user profile layout.

Row(
  crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.start,
  children: <Widget>[
    CircleAvatar(
      radius: 35,
      backgroundImage: NetworkImage(
        'https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33576285?v=4',
      ),
    ),
    Padding(padding: EdgeInsets.all(2.0)),
    Column(
      children: <Widget>[
        Text(
          'John Doe',
          style: TextStyle(
            fontSize: 20,
            fontWeight: FontWeight.bold,
          ),
        ),
        Text(
          'Flutter Developer',
          style: TextStyle(
            fontSize: 15,
          ),
        ),
      ],
    ),
  ],
)
Example 2: Login Form
In this example, you will learn how to build a simple login form using Column and Row, along with the TextField for input fields.

Column(
  mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
  children: <Widget>[
    const Row(
      children: <Widget>[
        Text('Username: '),
        Expanded(child: TextField()),
      ],
    ),
    const Row(
      children: <Widget>[
        Text('Password: '),
        Expanded(
          child: TextField(
            obscureText: true,
          ),
        ),
      ],
    ),
    Row(
      children: <Widget>[
        Expanded(
          child: MaterialButton(
            color: Colors.blue,
            textColor: Colors.white,
            onPressed: () {},
            child: const Text('Login'),
          ),
        ),
      ],
    ),
  ],
)
Example 3: Star Pattern
In this example, you will learn how to create a star pattern using Center, Column, and Row widgets, along with the Icon widget.

Center(
  child: Column(
    mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
    children: [
      // First row (one star in the middle)
      Row(
        mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
        children: [Icon(Icons.star, color: Colors.blue)],
      ),
      // Second row (one star in the middle)
      Row(
        mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
        children: [Icon(Icons.star, color: Colors.blue)],
      ),
      // Third row (five stars)
      Row(
        mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
        children: [
          Icon(Icons.star, color: Colors.blue),
          Icon(Icons.star, color: Colors.blue),
          Icon(Icons.star, color: Colors.blue),
          Icon(Icons.star, color: Colors.blue),
          Icon(Icons.star, color: Colors.blue),
        ],
      ),
      // Fourth row (one star in the middle)
      Row(
        mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
        children: [Icon(Icons.star, color: Colors.blue)],
      ),
      // Fifth row (one star in the middle)
      Row(
        mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
        children: [Icon(Icons.star, color: Colors.blue)],
      ),
    ],
  ),
),



STACK IN FLUTTER
Stack In Flutter
Imagine you’re making a sandwich. You put one ingredient on top of another, right? In Flutter, the Stack works similarly. It lets you put one thing (like a button or an image) on top of another. It’s super useful when you want things to overlap in your app’s design.

When to Use Stack
Buttons Over Pictures: Like a play button on a video thumbnail.
Text on Images: Like captions on photos.
Cool Designs: For when you want to mix things up from the usual top-down look.
 Info
Note: The first one is at the bottom, and each new one goes on top. In a Stack, your first widget is at the bottom, and others are layered over it.

Example 1: Basic Stack Implementation
Here’s how you can create a basic Stack with overlaid elements:

Stack(
  alignment: Alignment.center,
  children: [
    Container(
      width: 100,
      height: 100,
      color: Colors.blue,
    ),
    const Text('I’m on top!'),
  ],
)
Example 2: Profile Picture with Online Status Indicator
In this example, you will learn to create a circular profile picture with a small green dot at the bottom to indicate the user is online.

Stack(
  alignment: Alignment.bottomRight,
  children: [
    const CircleAvatar(
      radius: 40,
      backgroundImage: NetworkImage(
        'https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33576285?v=4'
      ),
    ),
    DecoratedBox(
      decoration: BoxDecoration(
        color: Colors.green,
        shape: BoxShape.circle,
        border: Border.all(color: Colors.white, width: 3),
      ),
      child: const SizedBox(width: 20, height: 20),
    ),
  ],
)
Positioned Widget
The Positioned widget is a special type of widget used inside a Stack widget to control the position of a child widget. It has the following useful properties:

Property	Description
top	Distance from the top edge of the stack.
bottom	Distance from the bottom edge of the stack.
left	Distance from the left edge of the stack.
right	Distance from the right edge of the stack.
You can see the demo of the Positioned widget in example 3 and 4.

Example 3: Product Image with Discount Badge
In this example, you will learn to create a product image with a discount badge at the top right corner.

Stack(
  children: [
    Image.network('https://images.pexels.com/photos/19060954/pexels-photo-19060954/free-photo-of-iphone-15-pro-max.jpeg'),
    Positioned(
      top: 10,
      right: 10,
      child: Container(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(8),
        color: Colors.red,
        child: const Text(
          '20% OFF',
          style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
        ),
      ),
    ),
  ],
)
Example 4: Overlay Text on Image
In this example, you will learn to overlay text on an image.

Stack(
  children: [
    Image.network(
      'https://images.pexels.com/photos/19060954/pexels-photo-19060954/free-photo-of-iphone-15-pro-max.jpeg'
    ),
    Positioned(
      bottom: 10,
      left: 10,
      child: DecoratedBox(
        decoration: BoxDecoration(
          color: Colors.black,
          borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(4),
        ),
        child: const Padding(
          padding: EdgeInsets.all(8),
          child: Text(
            'iPhone 15 Pro Max',
            style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    ),
  ],
)

      home: CounterScreen(),
    );
  }
}
Step 4: Create the CounterScreen Widget
Now, create the CounterScreen widget.


class CounterScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _CounterScreenState createState() => _CounterScreenState();
}

class _CounterScreenState extends State<CounterScreen> {
  // Define the counter variable
  int _counter = 0;

  // Define the increment and decrement counter methods
  void _incrementCounter() {
    setState(() {
      _counter++;
    });
  }

  void _decrementCounter() {
    setState(() {
      _counter--;
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: const Text('Counter App')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            Text(
              '$_counter',
              style: const TextStyle(fontSize: 72),
            ),
            Row(
              mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.spaceEvenly,
              children:[
                FloatingActionButton(
                  onPressed: _incrementCounter,
                  tooltip: 'Add',
                  child: const Icon(Icons.add),
                ),
                FloatingActionButton(
                  onPressed: _decrementCounter,
                  tooltip: 'Subtract',
                  child: const Icon(Icons.remove),
                ),
              ],
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
Step 5: Run the App
